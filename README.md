# Data-Visualization-With-matplotlib-python

Introduction:

This is a simple project to learn Matplotlib, a Python library for making charts and graphs. If you are new to data visualization, this repository will help you understand the basics step by step.

What You Will Learn

- How to make basic charts using Matplotlib
- How to customize your charts (titles, labels, colors, etc.)
- Different types of charts (line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, pie charts, etc.)
- How to create multiple charts in one figure (subplots)
- How to save your charts as images

Getting Started:

Install Python and Matplotlib

First, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Then, install Matplotlib by running:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

You might also need NumPy and Pandas for handling data:

```
pip install numpy pandas
```

Example Scripts:

Here are some example scripts included in this repository:

- BasicLinePlot.py: A simple line graph showing how to plot a basic trend using Matplotlib.
- BasicBarPlot.py: Demonstrates how to create a bar chart with different categories and customize colors.
- BasicBoxPlot.py: Shows how to create a box plot to visualize data distribution.
- BasicErrorBarPlot.py: Explains how to create error bars to show variability in data.
- BasicPiePlot.py: Example of creating a pie chart with labels and percentage values inside each slice.
- BasicScatterPlot.py: Shows how to create a scatter plot with markers to represent different data points.
- BasicStemPlot.py: Demonstrates how to create a stem plot for discrete data visualization.

These scripts will help you understand different types of plots and how to use Matplotlib effectively.
